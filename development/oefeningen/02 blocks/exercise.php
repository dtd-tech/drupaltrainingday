//   Administration > Structure Block layout (/admin/structure/block).
//   - In the region 'Footer first' click Place block
//   - Search for 'Powered by Drupal' and place the block
//     - Hide the block title
//     - Save the block
// - Go to the front page and check the result.

// ==== Step 2 ====
// As visitor I want to see a list of latest game reviews on the front page.
// - Place the block 'Recent content' in the right sidebar.
//   - Only show the block on the front page by entering '<front>' in
//     Visibility > Pages.
// - Go to the front page and check that the block is visible.
