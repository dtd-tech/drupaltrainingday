==== Step 1 ====
Add locally stored fonts styles.
- Copy the directories 'fonts' and 'font-awesome' to the theme. These contain
  localy stored font styles.
- Load the font-awesome style sheet to the library. Create a 'theme:' inside
  the 'css:' section of the library. Add this file to the library:
    font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css
  Don't forget to add the 'minified: true' flag.
- Clear the cache
- Check if the font-style is loaded.

==== Step 2 ====
Add remote fonts styles.
- This theme also uses a number of Google fonts. These will be loaded by the
  library too. Add the following remote font style URLs to the 'css: theme:' section
  of the library:
    http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:400,700
    http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Kaushan+Script
    http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Serif:400,700,400italic,700italic
    http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Slab:400,100,300,700
- Have you added the 'external: true' flag to each of the external font styles?
- Clear the cache
- Check if the font-styles are loaded.
