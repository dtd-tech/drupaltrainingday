==== Step 2 ====
Enable a custom theme.
 - Copy the wizzlern_agency folder from this exercise into the 'themes' folder
   in the Drupal installation directory.
 - Study the content of the wizzlern_agency.info.yml file you have just copied.
 - Go to Administration > Appearence (/admin/appearance). Enable the 'Wizzlern
   Agency' theme by clicking it's 'Install' link.
   This theme is the starting point of the custom Drupal theme that you will be
   building during this course.

==== Step 3 ====
Configure the website and add content.
 - Go to Administration > Extend (/admin/modules) and search for the 'Wizzlern
   Agency Content' module.
 - Enable the module by checking it's checkbox. Submit the configuration by
   clicking the 'Install' button. Click 'Continue' in the second screen.
   The module you have now enabled creates content on the front-page that you
   will be theming during this course.
 - Go to the Content page (/admin/content) and check if you see a list of
   content items.
