Create a theme library that takes care of CSS and JavaScript for the theme.
Estimated time: 15 min.

You will be working in:
- wizzlern_agency.libraries.yml

==== Step 1 ====
Create a libraries file for the theme.
 - Copy from the 'wizzlern_agency' directory in this exercise the
   'wizzlern_agency.libraries.yml' file the 'themes/wizzlern_agency' directory.
 - The wizzlern_agency.library.yml file is part of the theme. Adding it to the
   info.yml will make sure it is always loaded. Look for an example at
   core/themes/bartik/bartik.info.yml.
 - Add the library 'wizzlern_agency.global-styling' to the
   wizzlern_agency.info.yml file.
 - Clear all caches (/admin/config/development/performance).
 - Check that the for example the jQuery file is loaded.
 (Tip: In *.yml files indentation is relevant. Always use two paces, no tabs
  If you forget to indent, it will probably not work).

==== Step 2 ====
Use a separate library for logged-in users.
 - Copy the other files from the 'wizzlern_agency' folder into the
   'themes/wizzlern_agency' directory.
 - Clear the cache.
 - Check that agency-authenticated.css is only loaded when logged in. Not loaded
   when logged out.
