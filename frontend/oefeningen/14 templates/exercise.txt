Change the html output by overriding Drupal's templates.
Estimated time: 45 min.

You will be working in:
 - templates/form/form-element.html.twig
 - css/component/field.css
 - templates/block/block--contact-block.html.twig

==== Step 1 ====
Add a CSS class to all form elements.
 - In the design and in the original html (source) there is margin between the
   fields. Compare the source and the Drupal output of fields. Which class is
   used for this margin?
 - Use the <!--THEME DEBUG--> output to find out which template is responsible
   for the HTML of the field wrapper.
 - Copy the core/themes/stable/templates/form/... template you have found to
   the theme into templates/form/...
 - Add the missing class to this template field.
 - Clear the cache.
 - Check the result on the front page or on the login page.

==== Step 2 ====
Add styling to create margin
 - Add a CSS rule to the field.css style sheet to create margin between two
   fields.
 - Check if the styling matches the design.

==== Step 3 ====
You have now worked with two important Drupal theming tools: library and
template overrides. Lets go fast forward ...
 - Copy wizzlern_agency/css/* into the theme's css directory.
 - Copy wizzlern_agency/templates/* into the theme's templates directory.
 - Copy wizzlern_agency/images into the theme directory.
 - Be careful that you don't override existing files in the theme directory.

==== Step 4 ====
Provide markup for Contact block.
 - Compare original the markup of the contact-section (simplified version below)
   with the current markup.
 - Other sections (about, portfolio, service, teams) are build using blocks.
   Their block templates have been customized to produce the right output. The
   contact form is also placed in a block. Determine the name you will give
   the new template.
 - Copy the stable/templates/block/block.html.twig to templates/block and give
   it the name you chose.
 - Clear the cache.
 - Check that the new template is being used.
 - Modify the markup in the block template to match the desired output. Use as
   many Twig variables ( {{ ... }} ) from the original template.
 - Clear the cache and check the result.

---- Contact section HTML (simplified) ----

<section id="contact" class="section__contact">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Contact Us</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <form name="sentMessage" id="contactForm" novalidate="">
          <div class="row">

              <!-- Name field      -->
              <!-- Email field     -->

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <!-- Message field   -->
            </div>
            <div class="clearfix"></div>
            <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
              <div id="success"></div>
              <button type="submit" class="btn btn-xl">Send Message</button>
            </div>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
