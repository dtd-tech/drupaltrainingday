Add custom JavaScript to the theme.
Estimated time: 30 min.

You will be working in:
 - wizzlern_agency.libraries.yml
 - js/drupal-agency.js

==== Step 1 ====
Add JavaScript to the library.
 - If JavaScript is part of the theme it will be added to the library too.
 - Look in seven.libraries.yml for an example how to add JavaScript files to a
   libarary.
 - Copy the js directory from this exercise to the theme.
 - Add all files in this directory to wizzlern_agency.libraries.yml using the
   Puzzle pieces below.
 - Clear cache
 - Check the result. Are the libaries loaded? In header or footer of the page?

---- Puzzle pieces ----
js/agency.js
js/bootstrap.min.js
js/cbpAnimatedHeader.js
js/classie.js
js/drupal-agency.js
js/jqBootstrapValidation.js
js:
minified: true
type: external

==== Step 2 ====
Add external JavaScript to the library.
 - External JavaScript can be added to the library too. Add the jquery-easing
   and respond.js to the library using the Puzzle pieces below.
 - The respond.js is only for IE below 9. Use 'browsers: { ... }' for this file.
 - Clear cache
 - Check the result

---- Puzzle pieces ----
browsers: { IE: 'lt IE 9', !IE: false }
http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-easing/1.3/jquery.easing.min.js
https://oss.maxcdn.com/libs/respond.js/1.4.2/respond.min.js

===== Step 3 ====
Add your own custom JavaScript.
 - Add your custom JavaScript to the js/drupal-agency.js file. The Library
   has a dependency on jQuery, so jQuery is loaded and you can use it.
 - Use custom JavaScript to add classes 'img-responsive' and 'img-circle' to all
   team member images in '.section__team' and all timeline images in
   '.section__about'.
 - Add the class 'img-responsive' to all portfolio images in
   '.section__portfolio'.

===== Step 4 (extra) ====
Rework the JavaScript to use Drupal.behaviors
 - Is is a good practice to use Drupal.behaviors for re-usable JavaScript code.
 - Rework the code for the previous step to use a Drupal behavior. Use the
   example code below.

---- Example Drupal behavior ---

Drupal.behaviors.myBehavior = {
  attach: function (context, settings) {

    // Do some fancy stuff ... and on AJAX too.

  }
};
